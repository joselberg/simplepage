    <h1>Your logical fallacy is:</h1>
    <h1 class="answer">ad hominem</h1>
    <h2>You attacked your opponent's character or personal traits in an attempt to undermine their argument.</h2>
    <p>Ad hominem attacks can take the form of overtly attacking somebody, or more subtly casting doubt on their character or personal attributes as a way to discredit their argument. The result of an ad hom attack can be to undermine someone's case without actually having to engage with it.

    <p class="example">Example: After Sally presents an eloquent and compelling case for a more equitable taxation system, Sam asks the audience whether we should believe anything from a woman who isn't married, was once arrested, and smells a bit weird.</p>
